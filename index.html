          <h2 class="w3-center w3-aqua w3-margin-top w3-xxxlarge">You've chosen to be seen as a crewmate. Good choice.</h2>
          <h5 class="w3-center">The internet is a very big place and, like the crewmates on the skeld, its best to keep your digital footrprint clean so you dont become suspect. A digital footprint is the trail you leave behind on the internet. Everything from a comment on an instagram post to your name appearing on the news is permentant and can be found on the web so its best you follow these simple steps to make sure you havn't left a suspicious trail and prevent any future ones.</h5>
          <div class="w3-container w3-aqua w3-display-container" style= "height:250px; overflow:auto;">
            <p>1. Constantly Google Yourself - The best way to check your online presence is googling your name and checking if there is any bad or otherwise unappealing information.</p>
            <p>2. Monitor your social media accounts - Go back and look through your old posts to see if there might be anything that would make you look bad.</p>
            <p>3. Think twice before you post anything - Anything you say or do on the internet is permanent, so before hitting post make sure you run a confirmation through your mind the the post is positive.</p>
            <p>4. NEVER, and I mean NEVER give out personal inoformation - Staying anonymous is always preferable when online. Handing out your address, phone number, or social secuirity number can compromise any precaustion you've done so far.</p>
            <p>5. None of these rules sould bar you from using social media at all. Its actually beneficial if you post positive content in your feed. Instead of pictures as parties, try posting acomplishments and motivational words.</p>

          <h2 class="w3-center w3-red w3-margin-top w3-xxxlarge">So you Chose Imposter. How about you think again.</h2>
          <h5 class="w3-center">Like on the skeld, the fastest way to a cold and timley death out in space is to look like an imposter to your fellow crewmates. On the internet, your digital footprint can also lead to you looking suspicious like an imposter, and this can spell disaster in many different ways. Take a look below at how your digital footprint might shove you out of real world positions</h5>
          <div class="w3-container w3-red w3-display-container" style= "height:250px; overflow:auto;">
            <p>1. Did you know that as of 2017, 70% of all companies used social media screening when considering a future employee? Your boss could either stumble onto a slew of cat pictures, or that embarising picture from your highschool prom.</p>
            <p>2. Fama Technologies, a company that scans social media platforms and websites, states that they in 11 million posts and pages scaned, 14% were found to contain sexist and mysoginistic information while 10% was found to be racist. These posts can and will be found, and it can lead to you losing your job.</p>
            <p>3. A division 1 College Sports team dropped a 140,000$ scholarship because of a few tweets the student posted which contained rude comments and drug references. Even in sports the effect of a bad digital footprint can be seen.</p>
            <p>4. A single rude tweet cost a New Hampshire basketball player his Player of the Year award. This would have ruined his chances to compete further in college, and would likley follow him even when he begins looking for a job. </p>
